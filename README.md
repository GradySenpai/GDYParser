# GDYParser
## What is GDYParser
GDYParser is a dynamic string parser. It cuts up a string into **words** to make the string easier to work with. It was created with the
purpose of being used in a interpreter for a programming languages that I'm making. However, making it dynamic means it can be used in many
different cases.
## How To Use The Parser
You can change how the text is parsed by editing the **standard.init** file.
